# UITOUX_TASK

# STEPS TO FOLLOW

Install dependencies : npm install

Create .env file and use the values from env.example

Start the server : node index

Note: I have used the mongo cluster and provided the url in env. I have developed the api's for the given UI. For the images, I gave the sample images with http access. Because we have to put the sample images which I get in the requirement folder in the storage. Due to storage I didn't implement the blob. I have added the postman collection as json file.
